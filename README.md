We consider a simple model of a two CHPs using the block component in Pyomo. The CHPs are optimized against the electricity market. The cost function, consisting of gas costs and electricity revenues, is minimized.

The construction rule for the CHP block is located in blocks.py.

The results are evaluated in the evaluation.ipynb.
